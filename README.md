GURPS Character Editor
======================

A user-friendly GURPS character editor.

The purpose of this application is to relieve players and game masters alike from the number-crunching burdens of the game. The focus is on maintaining a character sheet, because it is where most of the calculations occurs.

Development style
-----------------

The application is developed using the Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) and following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern fairly rigorously. Furthermore unit testing is utilized, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) is used for non-trivial tasks.
